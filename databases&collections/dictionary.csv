keyword,definition,
algorithm,An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules designed to solve a definite problem. The problem can be simple like adding two numbers or a complex one  such as converting a video file from one format to another.
program,A computer program is termed as an organized collection of instructions  which when executed perform a specific task or function. A program is processed by the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer before it is executed. An example of a program is Microsoft Word  which is a word processing application that enables users to create and edit documents. The browsers that we use are also programs created to help us browse the internet.
pointer,In computer science a pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory or in some cases that of memory-mapped computer hardware. A pointer references a location in memory and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlying computer architecture.
variable,In computer programming a variable or scalar is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
loop,Loops in programming come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.
structure,Structured programming (sometimes known as modular programming) is a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components.
